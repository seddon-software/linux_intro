If a program was stuck in memory it would run faster than other programs (they would be swapped out to disk when their time slice ended).  As Unix became more sophisticated this mechanism was replaced by paging in and out virtual memory and the 'sticky' bit was no longer required.  Since the 't' permission was available it was reassigned as above, but the name wasn't changed."
