This folder contains a number of Linux tutorials.  All the tutorials use
jupyter notebook.

To run these tutorials we need to first install Jupyter bash kernel:

    pip install bash_kernel --user
    python -m bash_kernel.install --user
    pip install jupyterthemes --user
    jupyter kernelspec list


Before you start the notebook perform a little CSS customisation by running:

    ./setup

This will copy custom.css to the Jupyter config directory.

Then to start Jupyter notebook:

    module load python/3.7
    jupyter notebook &


Just for the record, the tutorials were downloaded with:

    git clone https://github.com/seddon-software/linux_intro.git
