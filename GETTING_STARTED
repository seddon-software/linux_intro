This folder contains a number of Linux tutorials.  All the tutorials use
jupyter notebook.

Before anything else you need to setup your environment by typing the following on the command line:

    module load python/3.7
or
    module load python/3.8

Make sure you don't have any other versions of Python or gcc loaded - unload as necessary.  For example:

    module unload python/ana

To run these tutorials we need to first install Jupyter bash kernel:

    pip install bash_kernel --user
    python -m bash_kernel.install --user
    pip install jupyterthemes --user
    
To check which kernels have been installed:

    jupyter kernelspec list

Before you start the notebook perform a little CSS customisation by running:

    cd resources
    ./setup
    cd ..

This will copy custom.css to the Jupyter config directory.

Then to start Jupyter notebook:

    jupyter notebook --browser firefox &

Just for the record, the tutorials were downloaded with:

    git clone https://github.com/seddon-software/linux_intro.git
