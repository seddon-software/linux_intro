Download the Linux tutorials with:
    git clone https://github.com/seddon-software/linux_intro.git

This will create a subfolder containing several Linux tutorials.  All the tutorials use Jupyter notebook.  cd into this folder:
    cd linux_intro

Now you need to setup your environment by typing the following:
    module load python

Make sure you don't have any other versions of Python loaded - unload as necessary.  For example:
    module unload python/3.7

To run these tutorials we need to first install the Jupyter bash kernel:
    pip install bash_kernel --user
    python -m bash_kernel.install --user
    pip install jupyterthemes --user
    
To check which kernels have been installed:
    jupyter kernelspec list

Before you start the notebook perform a little CSS customisation by running:
    cd resources
    ./setup
    cd ..

This will copy custom.css to the Jupyter config directory.

Then to start Jupyter notebook:
    jupyter notebook &

Your instructor will take it from there.
