    "Over the years many utility programs have been written for the Unix operating system with varying degrees of usefulness.  A number of these commands are called filters and can be combined using Unix pipes to create more complex programs.  However, times change and many of these filtrs have been superseeded by writing small Python scripts.  Nevertheless you can still find Linux tutorials on the web that detail how to use these commands.  I suggest that we don't spend time on these commands:\n",
