Interestingly, the multiple filenames don't have to be in the same directory; you can use a more complicated path in the ln command to achieve this.  It turns out that this can be very useful (see later), but there is a problem with doing so.  This is because disk or disks are split into multiple filesystems called partitions.  inodes are only unique with a given partition and the 'ln' command can't cross partitions.  This wasn't a problem in the early days of Unix because we only had one or two partitions.\n",
